"""
The methods before this comment are particularly written 
using the verb "choose" and not "change" because we thought
the former seems more logical and appropriate in 
representing the real object. In the real world, people 
don't change the attributes like size, type, brand, etc.
of a particular object, but rather choose it among the 
available choices in the market.
